## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- Ahead-of-time Ray.Di compilation that separates a read-only `compileDir` from a
  writable `tmpDir`, so a compiled injector can run under a read-only root
  filesystem.
- `BakedPathGuard`, which scans compiled scripts for baked-in `appDir`/`tmpDir`
  paths (or custom needles) and fails the compile before anything unsafe reaches
  `compileDir`.
- The `bin/ray-di-compile` CLI for compiling a context ahead of time; see the
  README's *Exit status* table for its exit codes.
